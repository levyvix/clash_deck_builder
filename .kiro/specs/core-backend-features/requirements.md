# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Clash Royale Deck Builder backend currently has skeleton implementations but lacks several core features needed for a functional application. This spec focuses on implementing the missing core backend functionality including the main FastAPI application, proper database integration, real Clash Royale API integration, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured FastAPI application with all routes registered, so that the backend can serve API requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN the FastAPI application SHALL be accessible on the configured port
2. WHEN a client makes a request to /cards THEN the system SHALL return card data from the Clash Royale API
3. WHEN a client makes requests to /decks endpoints THEN the system SHALL handle deck CRUD operations
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all API routes SHALL be properly registered and documented

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real integration with the Clash Royale API, so that the application can fetch actual card data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches cards from the Clash Royale API THEN it SHALL use the provided API key for authentication
2. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL transform the raw API data into Card models
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN card data is fetched THEN it SHALL include all required fields (name, elixir_cost, rarity, type, arena, image_url)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper MySQL database integration, so that deck data can be persisted and retrieved reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection to the MySQL database
2. WHEN deck operations are performed THEN they SHALL use proper database transactions
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and rollback transactions
4. WHEN the database schema is needed THEN it SHALL be properly initialized with the required tables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management, so that the application can be configured for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN database connection is needed THEN it SHALL use the configured database URL
3. WHEN Clash Royale API is called THEN it SHALL use the configured API key
4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that the application provides meaningful feedback when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN the Clash Royale API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a 503 Service Unavailable status
3. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation details
4. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection, so that services can be easily tested and configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints need services THEN they SHALL use FastAPI dependency injection
2. WHEN database connections are needed THEN they SHALL be provided through dependency injection
3. WHEN the Clash Royale API service is needed THEN it SHALL be injected with proper configuration
4. WHEN testing THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deck service to properly handle card data serialization, so that complex card objects can be stored in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving a deck THEN card data SHALL be properly serialized to JSON
2. WHEN retrieving a deck THEN card data SHALL be properly deserialized from JSON
3. WHEN card data is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle serialization errors gracefully
4. WHEN evolution slots are used THEN they SHALL be properly serialized and deserialized

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper average elixir calculation, so that deck statistics are accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deck is created or updated THEN the average elixir SHALL be calculated automatically
2. WHEN cards are added to a deck THEN the average elixir SHALL be recalculated
3. WHEN evolution slots are used THEN they SHALL be included in the elixir calculation
4. WHEN the deck has no cards THEN the average elixir SHALL be 0
