# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Clash Royale Deck Builder currently has backend code that expects a MySQL database connection, but lacks a containerized database setup for development and deployment. This spec focuses on implementing Docker-based MySQL database integration that provides a consistent, reproducible database environment for all developers and deployment scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Docker-based MySQL database setup, so that I can run the application locally without installing MySQL directly on my machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run docker-compose up THEN a MySQL database container SHALL be created and started
2. WHEN the MySQL container starts THEN it SHALL initialize with the required database schema
3. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN it SHALL use the containerized MySQL instance
4. WHEN I stop the containers THEN the database data SHALL persist in Docker volumes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be automatically initialized, so that I don't need to manually create tables and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MySQL container starts for the first time THEN it SHALL execute initialization scripts
2. WHEN the schema is created THEN it SHALL include all required tables (users, decks, cards)
3. WHEN the schema is created THEN it SHALL include proper indexes for performance
4. WHEN the schema is created THEN it SHALL include foreign key constraints for data integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend application to be containerized, so that the entire stack runs consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run docker-compose up THEN both database and backend containers SHALL start
2. WHEN the backend container starts THEN it SHALL wait for the database to be ready
3. WHEN the backend connects to the database THEN it SHALL use the internal Docker network
4. WHEN the backend is running THEN it SHALL be accessible from the host machine

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration, so that I can run the application in development, testing, and production modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the database SHALL use development-specific credentials
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN the database SHALL use secure, environment-specific credentials
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the containers SHALL pick up the new settings without code changes
4. WHEN sensitive data is needed THEN it SHALL be provided through environment variables or secrets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migrations and seeding capabilities, so that I can manage schema changes and test data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database starts THEN it SHALL run any pending migrations automatically
2. WHEN in development mode THEN the database SHALL be seeded with sample card data
3. WHEN schema changes are made THEN they SHALL be applied through versioned migration scripts
4. WHEN rolling back changes THEN migration rollback SHALL be supported

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database backup and restore capabilities, so that I can protect and recover data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a backup command THEN it SHALL create a timestamped database dump
2. WHEN I run a restore command THEN it SHALL restore the database from a specified backup
3. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL be stored in a persistent volume
4. WHEN restoring data THEN the existing data SHALL be safely replaced

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database monitoring and health checks, so that I can ensure the database is running properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database container is running THEN it SHALL respond to health check queries
2. WHEN the database is unhealthy THEN the container SHALL restart automatically
3. WHEN monitoring the database THEN I SHALL be able to view connection status and performance metrics
4. WHEN the database fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be logged

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to work seamlessly with the containerized backend, so that the full application stack runs together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL connect to the containerized backend
2. WHEN running the full stack THEN all services SHALL communicate through Docker networking
3. WHEN developing locally THEN I SHALL be able to run frontend and backend independently or together
4. WHEN the backend API changes THEN the frontend SHALL continue to work without container rebuilds
