# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refining the Clash Royale Deck Builder frontend with Material Design principles, smooth animations, drag-and-drop functionality, bug fixes for duplicate cards and API endpoints, and Docker containerization. The goal is to create a polished, professional user experience with intuitive interactions and proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Material Design Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to follow Material Design principles, so that the interface feels modern, consistent, and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all components SHALL use Material Design elevation, shadows, and spacing
2. WHEN cards are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper Material Design card styling with elevation levels
3. WHEN buttons are rendered THEN they SHALL follow Material Design button styles (contained, outlined, text)
4. WHEN interactive elements are hovered THEN they SHALL show Material Design ripple effects
5. WHEN transitions occur THEN they SHALL use Material Design motion curves (ease-in-out, duration 200-300ms)
6. WHEN the rarity text is displayed on cards THEN the font size SHALL be reduced to prevent clipping
7. WHEN the elixir cost is displayed on cards THEN it SHALL use a droplet icon instead of a lightning icon

### Requirement 2: Drag and Drop Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag cards from the gallery to my deck and drag them out to remove them, so that deck building feels intuitive and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and drag a card from the gallery THEN the card SHALL follow my cursor with visual feedback
2. WHEN I drag a card over an empty deck slot THEN the slot SHALL highlight to indicate it's a valid drop target
3. WHEN I drop a card on an empty deck slot THEN the card SHALL be added to that slot with a smooth animation
4. WHEN I drag a card from a deck slot THEN the card SHALL follow my cursor
5. WHEN I drag a card outside the deck area THEN the card SHALL be removed from the deck with a fade-out animation
6. WHEN I drop a card on an occupied deck slot THEN the cards SHALL swap positions
7. WHEN dragging is in progress THEN a ghost/preview image SHALL follow the cursor
8. WHEN a drag operation completes THEN the UI SHALL update immediately with smooth transitions

### Requirement 3: Duplicate Card Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be prevented from adding the same card multiple times to my deck, so that my deck follows Clash Royale rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card is added to the deck THEN that card SHALL be visually marked as "in deck" in the gallery
2. WHEN a card is already in the deck THEN clicking or dragging it SHALL show a notification "Card already in deck"
3. WHEN a card is in the deck THEN it SHALL have a disabled/dimmed appearance in the gallery
4. WHEN a card is removed from the deck THEN it SHALL become available again in the gallery
5. WHEN the deck is cleared THEN all cards SHALL become available in the gallery

### Requirement 4: Save Deck API Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully save my deck with a name, so that I can access it later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click save deck THEN the system SHALL call the correct API endpoint (POST /api/decks)
2. WHEN the save request is made THEN it SHALL include the deck name and all 8 cards with evolution flags
3. WHEN the save succeeds THEN the system SHALL show a success notification "Deck saved successfully"
4. WHEN the save fails with 404 THEN the system SHALL check the API endpoint configuration
5. WHEN the save fails with network error THEN the system SHALL show "Cannot connect to server"
6. WHEN the save fails with validation error THEN the system SHALL show the specific error message
7. WHEN a deck is saved THEN the deck list SHALL refresh to show the new deck

### Requirement 5: Saved Decks Page Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my saved decks without errors, so that I can manage and load them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to saved decks page THEN the system SHALL call the correct API endpoint (GET /api/decks)
2. WHEN the fetch succeeds THEN all saved decks SHALL be displayed in a grid layout
3. WHEN the fetch fails with 404 THEN the system SHALL verify the API endpoint exists in the backend
4. WHEN the fetch fails with network error THEN the system SHALL show "Cannot connect to server" with retry button
5. WHEN no decks exist THEN the system SHALL show "No saved decks yet" message
6. WHEN the retry button is clicked THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch decks again

### Requirement 6: Frontend Docker Containerization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to run in a Docker container, so that the entire application can be deployed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend Dockerfile is created THEN it SHALL use a multi-stage build (build stage + nginx stage)
2. WHEN the frontend container builds THEN it SHALL install dependencies and create an optimized production build
3. WHEN the frontend container runs THEN it SHALL serve the static files via nginx
4. WHEN the frontend container starts THEN it SHALL be accessible on the configured port
5. WHEN docker-compose is used THEN the frontend service SHALL be defined with proper networking
6. WHEN the frontend connects to backend THEN it SHALL use the correct API URL from environment variables
7. WHEN environment variables change THEN the container SHALL support runtime configuration
8. WHEN the container is built THEN it SHALL include a .dockerignore file to exclude node_modules and build artifacts

### Requirement 7: Smooth Animations and Transitions

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations throughout the application, so that interactions feel polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card is added to the deck THEN it SHALL animate with a scale and fade-in effect (300ms)
2. WHEN a card is removed from the deck THEN it SHALL animate with a scale and fade-out effect (300ms)
3. WHEN filters are applied THEN the card gallery SHALL update with a staggered fade-in animation
4. WHEN hovering over cards THEN they SHALL lift with a smooth elevation change (200ms)
5. WHEN notifications appear THEN they SHALL slide in from the top-right (250ms)
6. WHEN notifications dismiss THEN they SHALL slide out to the right (250ms)
7. WHEN the deck is complete THEN the save button SHALL pulse with a subtle animation
8. WHEN loading states occur THEN skeleton loaders SHALL have a shimmer animation

### Requirement 8: API Service Layer Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the API service layer is correctly configured, so that all endpoints work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API service is initialized THEN it SHALL use the base URL from environment variables
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper headers (Content-Type: application/json)
3. WHEN the backend returns errors THEN the frontend SHALL parse and display them correctly
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the frontend SHALL handle them gracefully
5. WHEN the API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL match the backend route definitions exactly
6. WHEN debugging API issues THEN console logs SHALL show the full request URL and payload
