# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the user experience of the Clash Royale Deck Builder by making the deck area sticky during scrolling and removing visual clutter from evolution cards. These changes will help users maintain visibility of their current deck while browsing cards and provide a cleaner interface for evolution cards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sticky Deck Positioning

**User Story:** As a user, I want the deck area to remain visible when I scroll down through the card gallery, so that I can always see my current deck composition without losing track of my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll down in the card gallery THEN the deck area SHALL remain fixed in its position on the screen
2. WHEN the deck area becomes sticky THEN it SHALL maintain its original styling and functionality
3. WHEN scrolling on mobile devices THEN the sticky deck SHALL not interfere with touch interactions
4. WHEN the deck area is sticky THEN it SHALL have appropriate z-index to appear above scrolling content
5. WHEN scrolling back to the top THEN the deck area SHALL return to its original position seamlessly
6. WHEN the viewport is too small THEN the sticky behavior SHALL be disabled to prevent layout issues

### Requirement 2: Remove Evolution Card Star

**User Story:** As a user, I want evolution cards to display without the star symbol, so that the interface is cleaner and less cluttered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an evolution card in the gallery THEN it SHALL NOT display a star symbol
2. WHEN viewing an evolution card in a deck slot THEN it SHALL NOT display a star symbol
3. WHEN an evolution card is selected or highlighted THEN it SHALL maintain its evolution status without the star
4. WHEN evolution cards are filtered or searched THEN they SHALL still be identifiable as evolution cards through other visual means
5. WHEN evolution functionality is used THEN the removal of the star SHALL not affect the underlying evolution logic
6. WHEN evolution cards are saved in decks THEN the star removal SHALL not affect data persistence

### Requirement 3: Maintain Existing Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing deck building functionality to continue working normally, so that the UI improvements don't break current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deck becomes sticky THEN drag-and-drop functionality SHALL continue to work normally
2. WHEN evolution stars are removed THEN evolution card selection SHALL continue to function
3. WHEN UI changes are applied THEN deck saving and loading SHALL remain unaffected
4. WHEN UI changes are applied THEN card filtering and searching SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN UI changes are applied THEN responsive design SHALL be maintained across all device sizes
6. WHEN UI changes are applied THEN all animations and transitions SHALL continue to function smoothly
