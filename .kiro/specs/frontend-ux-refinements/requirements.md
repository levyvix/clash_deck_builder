# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refining the Clash Royale Deck Builder frontend to fix critical bugs, implement drag-and-drop functionality, apply Material Design principles, and add smooth animations for a polished user experience. The current implementation has several issues including clipped rarity text, missing drag-and-drop interactions, duplicate card bugs, broken API endpoints, and lack of visual polish.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Visual Display Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want card information to be clearly visible and properly formatted, so that I can easily identify card details without visual clipping or formatting issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a card THEN the rarity text SHALL be fully visible without clipping
2. WHEN viewing a card THEN the rarity font size SHALL be reduced to fit within the card display area
3. WHEN viewing cards of different rarities THEN each rarity SHALL display with its correct color coding (Common: gray, Rare: orange, Epic: purple, Legendary: gold, Champion: gold)
4. WHEN viewing a card THEN all text elements (name, elixir, rarity) SHALL be properly aligned and spaced

### Requirement 2: Implement Drag-and-Drop Card Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag cards from the gallery to my deck and drag them out to remove them, so that I can build decks with intuitive interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and hold a card in the gallery THEN the card SHALL become draggable with visual feedback
2. WHEN I drag a card over an empty deck slot THEN the slot SHALL highlight to indicate it's a valid drop target
3. WHEN I drop a card on an empty deck slot THEN the card SHALL be added to that slot
4. WHEN I drag a card from a filled deck slot THEN the card SHALL become draggable
5. WHEN I drag a card out of the deck area THEN a removal zone SHALL appear
6. WHEN I drop a deck card on the removal zone THEN the card SHALL be removed from the deck
7. WHEN dragging a card THEN a ghost/preview image SHALL follow the cursor
8. WHEN a drag operation completes THEN smooth animations SHALL transition the card to its final position

### Requirement 3: Prevent Duplicate Cards in Deck

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be prevented from adding the same card multiple times to my deck, so that I build valid Clash Royale decks according to game rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card is already in my deck THEN that card SHALL be visually marked as "in deck" in the gallery
2. WHEN I attempt to add a card that's already in my deck THEN the system SHALL prevent the addition
3. WHEN I attempt to add a duplicate card THEN the system SHALL display a notification "Card already in deck"
4. WHEN I remove a card from my deck THEN that card SHALL become available again in the gallery
5. WHEN viewing the card gallery THEN cards in my current deck SHALL have a distinct visual indicator (e.g., dimmed, checkmark, border)

### Requirement 4: Fix Deck Save API Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my deck with a name, so that I can store and retrieve my deck configurations later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the save button with a valid deck (8 cards) THEN the system SHALL prompt for a deck name
2. WHEN I enter a deck name and confirm THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to the correct API endpoint
3. WHEN the save request succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success notification "Deck saved successfully"
4. WHEN the save request fails with 404 THEN the system SHALL check and correct the API endpoint URL
5. WHEN the save request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error notification with the failure reason
6. WHEN I save a deck THEN the deck SHALL include all 8 cards, evolution flags, and the deck name
7. WHEN I save a deck THEN the API request SHALL use the correct request format expected by the backend

### Requirement 5: Fix Saved Decks Page API Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my saved decks on the saved decks page, so that I can manage and load my deck configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the saved decks page THEN the system SHALL fetch decks from the correct API endpoint
2. WHEN the fetch request succeeds THEN the system SHALL display all saved decks in a grid layout
3. WHEN the fetch request fails with 404 THEN the system SHALL check and correct the API endpoint URL
4. WHEN the fetch request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with a retry button
5. WHEN I click retry THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch decks again
6. WHEN no decks exist THEN the system SHALL display "No saved decks yet" message
7. WHEN decks are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator

### Requirement 6: Apply Material Design Principles

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to follow Material Design guidelines, so that I have a modern, consistent, and intuitive user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any component THEN it SHALL use Material Design elevation levels (cards: 2dp, dialogs: 24dp)
2. WHEN viewing interactive elements THEN they SHALL have appropriate ripple effects on interaction
3. WHEN viewing the layout THEN it SHALL use Material Design spacing units (4dp, 8dp, 16dp, 24dp)
4. WHEN viewing typography THEN it SHALL follow Material Design type scale (headlines, body, captions)
5. WHEN viewing colors THEN they SHALL follow Material Design color system with primary, secondary, and surface colors
6. WHEN viewing buttons THEN they SHALL follow Material Design button styles (contained, outlined, text)
7. WHEN viewing cards THEN they SHALL have rounded corners (4dp border radius) and proper shadows

### Requirement 7: Implement Smooth Animations

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations throughout the application, so that interactions feel polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card is added to the deck THEN it SHALL animate smoothly from the gallery to the deck slot (300ms ease-out)
2. WHEN a card is removed from the deck THEN it SHALL fade out smoothly (200ms ease-in)
3. WHEN hovering over a card THEN it SHALL scale up slightly with a smooth transition (150ms ease-out)
4. WHEN a notification appears THEN it SHALL slide in from the right (250ms ease-out)
5. WHEN a notification dismisses THEN it SHALL slide out to the right (200ms ease-in)
6. WHEN filters are applied THEN the card gallery SHALL update with a fade transition (200ms)
7. WHEN a dialog opens THEN it SHALL fade in with a scale animation (250ms ease-out)
8. WHEN a dialog closes THEN it SHALL fade out with a scale animation (200ms ease-in)
9. WHEN page transitions occur THEN they SHALL use smooth fade transitions (300ms)
10. WHEN any animation plays THEN it SHALL use CSS transforms for performance (translate, scale, opacity only)

### Requirement 8: Enhance User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback for all my actions, so that I understand what's happening in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any action THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN an action is processing THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN an action succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success notification with a checkmark icon
4. WHEN an action fails THEN the system SHALL display an error notification with an error icon
5. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN they SHALL change appearance to indicate interactivity
6. WHEN I click a button THEN it SHALL show a pressed state
7. WHEN the deck is incomplete THEN the save button SHALL be disabled with a tooltip explaining why
8. WHEN the deck is complete THEN the save button SHALL be enabled and highlighted

### Requirement 9: Improve Responsive Behavior

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the application to work smoothly on my screen size, so that I can build decks on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile (< 768px) THEN the card gallery SHALL display 2 columns
2. WHEN viewing on tablet (768px - 1200px) THEN the card gallery SHALL display 4 columns
3. WHEN viewing on desktop (> 1200px) THEN the card gallery SHALL display 6 columns
4. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the deck slots SHALL stack in a single column or 2x4 grid
5. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN drag-and-drop SHALL work with touch events
6. WHEN viewing on any device THEN all text SHALL be readable without zooming
7. WHEN viewing on any device THEN all interactive elements SHALL be easily tappable (minimum 44x44px)
