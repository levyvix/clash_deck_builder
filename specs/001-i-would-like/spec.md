**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i would like to build a clash royale deck builder with simple UI. using the clash royale api and a key i have. the web app need to have all the cards, with correct color for rarity, correct format for legendary, champion and tower cards. i can filter for elixir asc or descending, i can filter for name, rarity and arena. i can filter for evolution cards, troop cards, spell cards and building cards. all decks can have 2 evo spots, and when they are put in evo slot, the image of the card should change to evo, including the gem at the top. the deck should display the average exilir. all cards must be level 11. i can save many decks, name them, or delete them. all decks should be saved in a mysql database for persistance."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Clash Royale player, I want to build, save, and manage multiple decks using a simple web interface, leveraging the Clash Royale API to view card details and apply various filters.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the deck builder page, **When** I view the card list, **Then** I see all Clash Royale cards with correct rarity colors and special formatting for Legendary, Champion, and Tower cards.
2. **Given** I am viewing the card list, **When** I apply filters for elixir (ascending/descending), name, rarity, arena, evolution cards, troop cards, spell cards, or building cards, **Then** the card list updates to show only matching cards.
3. **Given** I am building a deck, **When** I add cards to the deck, **Then** the average elixir cost is displayed, and I can assign up to two cards to evolution slots, which changes their image to an evolved version with a gem.
4. **Given** I have built a deck, **When** I save the deck with a name, **Then** the deck is stored in a MySQL database for persistence.
5. **Given** I have saved multiple decks, **When** I view my saved decks, **Then** I can select, rename, or delete them.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Clash Royale API is unavailable or returns an error? The system MUST display an error page.
- How does the system handle invalid card data from the API? The system MUST try again or display an error page.
- What are the limits on the number of saved decks? Users can save up to 20 decks.
