# Cards API Endpoint Test Results

## Task 4: Update cards API endpoint to use database

### Test Summary
All tests passed successfully! The cards API endpoint has been successfully migrated from using the external Clash Royale API to using the database-backed CardService.

### Tests Performed

#### 1. Direct Service Test ✓
**File:** `test_cards_endpoint.py`
**Result:** PASSED
- Successfully retrieved 120 cards from database
- Card data structure validated correctly
- All required fields present (id, name, elixir_cost, rarity, type, arena, image_url)

#### 2. HTTP Integration Test ✓
**File:** `test_cards_api_http.py`
**Result:** PASSED
- HTTP endpoint `/cards/cards` returns 200 OK
- Successfully retrieved 120 cards via HTTP
- Response format matches expected Card model
- JSON serialization working correctly

### Implementation Verification

#### Changes Made:
1. ✓ Removed ClashRoyaleAPIService dependency
2. ✓ Added CardService dependency injection
3. ✓ Updated imports (DatabaseError, MySQLError)
4. ✓ Modified endpoint to call `card_service.get_all_cards()`
5. ✓ Implemented proper error handling:
   - Connection errors (MySQL errno 2003, 2006, 2013, 2055) → 503 Service Unavailable
   - Query errors and other database issues → 500 Internal Server Error
   - Unexpected errors → 500 Internal Server Error
6. ✓ Maintained backward compatibility (response format unchanged)

#### Requirements Satisfied:
- ✓ 3.1: Database integration
- ✓ 3.2: Error handling for database operations
- ✓ 3.3: Proper HTTP status code mapping
- ✓ 3.4: Connection failure handling (503)
- ✓ 3.5: Query error handling (500)
- ✓ 5.1: Backward compatibility maintained
- ✓ 5.2: Response format unchanged

### Sample Output
