# Task 17: Fix Saved Decks Page API Call - Verification

## Issue Identified

The frontend was calling `/decks` endpoint, but the backend has a routing structure where:
- The router is registered with `prefix="/decks"` in `main.py`
- The route is defined as `@router.get("/decks")` in `decks.py`
- This creates the full path: `/decks/decks`

This is consistent with the cards endpoint which uses `/cards/cards`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `fetchDecks` Function
**File**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

Changed from:
```typescript
const url = `${API_BASE_URL}/decks`;
```

To:
```typescript
const url = `${API_BASE_URL}/decks/decks`;
```

Added comprehensive logging:
- Full URL being called
- Request timestamp
- Response status and headers
- Data received (count and sample)
- Detailed error information

### 2. Updated All Deck-Related Endpoints

Updated the following functions to use the correct path:
- `fetchDecks()`: `GET /decks/decks`
- `createDeck()`: `POST /decks/decks`
- `updateDeck()`: `PUT /decks/decks/{deck_id}`
- `deleteDeck()`: `DELETE /decks/decks/{deck_id}`

### 3. Updated Endpoint Verification

Updated the `verifyEndpoints()` function to test the correct URLs:
```typescript
{ name: 'Fetch Decks', method: 'GET', url: `${API_BASE_URL}/decks/decks` },
{ name: 'Create Deck', method: 'POST', url: `${API_BASE_URL}/decks/decks` },
```

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Test with Running Application

1. **Start the backend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up backend database
   ```

2. **Start the frontend** (in development mode):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open browser console** and navigate to the Saved Decks page

4. **Check the console logs** for:
   ```
   üîç ===== FETCH DECKS REQUEST =====
   üìç Full URL: http://localhost:8000/decks/decks
   üåê Method: GET
   üí° Note: Using /decks/decks due to backend router prefix
   ```

5. **Verify the response**:
   - Status should be `200 OK`
   - Should see deck data or empty array `[]`
   - No 404 errors

### Option 2: Test with Browser/Postman

1. **Ensure backend is running**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up backend database
   ```

2. **Test the endpoint directly**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/decks/decks
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   []
   ```
   or
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "My Deck",
       "slots": [...],
       "average_elixir": 3.5
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Test in browser**:
   - Open: http://localhost:8000/decks/decks
   - Should see JSON response (not 404)

### Option 3: Use the Built-in Verification Function

1. **Open browser console** on any page of the app

2. **Run the verification function**:
   ```javascript
   // Import the function (if not already available)
   import { verifyEndpoints } from './services/api';
   
   // Run verification
   verifyEndpoints();
   ```

3. **Check the output** for all endpoints including:
   ```
   üì° Testing: Fetch Decks
      Method: GET
      URL: http://localhost:8000/decks/decks
      ‚úÖ Status: 200 OK
      üìä Response: Array with 0 items
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Console shows: `GET http://localhost:8000/decks 404 (Not Found)`
- ‚ùå Error: "Endpoint not found - check API configuration"
- ‚ùå Saved Decks page shows error message

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Console shows: `GET http://localhost:8000/decks/decks 200 (OK)`
- ‚úÖ Saved Decks page loads successfully
- ‚úÖ Shows "No saved decks yet" if empty, or displays saved decks

## Requirements Verified

‚úÖ **Requirement 5.1**: `fetchDecks` function calls correct endpoint (GET /decks/decks)
‚úÖ **Requirement 8.5**: Console logs show full request URL for debugging

## Additional Notes

### Backend Route Structure
The backend uses a nested routing pattern:
```python
# main.py
app.include_router(decks.router, prefix="/decks", tags=["decks"])

# decks.py
@router.get("/decks")  # Full path becomes /decks/decks
@router.post("/decks")  # Full path becomes /decks/decks
@router.get("/decks/{deck_id}")  # Full path becomes /decks/decks/{deck_id}
```

### Why This Pattern?
This pattern is consistent with the cards endpoint:
- Cards: `prefix="/cards"` + `@router.get("/cards")` = `/cards/cards`
- Decks: `prefix="/decks"` + `@router.get("/decks")` = `/decks/decks`

### Alternative Solution
The backend could be refactored to use:
```python
# decks.py
@router.get("/")  # Would make full path /decks
@router.post("/")  # Would make full path /decks
@router.get("/{deck_id}")  # Would make full path /decks/{deck_id}
```

However, this would require backend changes and is outside the scope of this task.

## Debugging Tips

If you still see 404 errors:

1. **Verify backend is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Check CORS configuration** in backend

3. **Verify API_BASE_URL** in frontend:
   - Check `frontend/.env` file
   - Should be: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`

4. **Check browser console** for the exact URL being called

5. **Test backend endpoint directly** with curl or Postman
